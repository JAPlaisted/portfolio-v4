                <h2>The Last Man</h2>
                <p>
                It was a typical morning for John. He woke up to the sound of birds chirping outside his window, made himself a cup of coffee, and checked the news on his phone. But as he scrolled through the headlines, he came across something that made his blood run cold.
                <br />
                <br />
                "Worldwide Suicide Pact Announced - Everyone to Take Their Own Lives at Midnight Tonight."
                <br />
                <br />
                John couldn't believe what he was reading. He quickly called his wife, but she didn't pick up. He tried his friends, but their phones were off. He even tried to call his parents, but they didn't answer either.
                <br />
                <br />
                As the day went on, John watched in shock as the world around him seemed to accept this suicide pact. People were calmly going about their business, making preparations for their deaths. His coworkers talked about it as if it were just another day at the office.
                <br />
                <br />
                His family and friends were no different. They had all made the decision to participate in the pact, and they were convinced that it was the right thing to do. They tried to convince John to join them, telling him that he would regret it if he didn't. But John couldn't bring himself to agree with them. He didn't understand why everyone was so eager to end their lives.
                <br />
                <br />
                As the hours ticked by, John watched as the world around him prepared for its own demise. People hugged their loved oneâ€™s goodbye, made peace with their pasts, and said their final farewells. But John couldn't shake the feeling that there had to be another way.
                <br />
                <br />
                Midnight came and went, and John watched from his window as the world outside fell silent. The streets were empty, the houses were dark, and the only sound was the wind whispering through the deserted city.
                <br />
                <br />
                John was alone, the only living person left on a planet full of the dead. He wandered the empty streets, trying to come to terms with what had just happened. He felt guilty for being alive when everyone else was gone, but he also felt a sense of peace. He had always felt like an outsider, and now he truly was.
                <br />
                <br />
                He knew he would spend the rest of his days alone, but he was at peace with that. He would spend his time exploring the world, discovering the beauty of the natural world that had been hidden beneath the chaos of human civilization. He would live his life for himself, and for the other non-human animals that shared the planet with him. He would be their caretaker, and they would be his company.
                John realized that, while the rest of the world had chosen to end their lives, he had been given a second chance. He would make the most of it and live a life worth living.
